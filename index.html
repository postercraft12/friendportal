    			Hello, and welcome to friend portal, my website. This is where my friends can come and share stuff or update their pages. Kind of like facebook for only my friends. Under this message are buttons that can take you to all of our pages, or your page to update your own. You can also go to the chat wall to chat with everyone. Hopefully you like it and take care!
